Observable trends based on the data:

1. From the scatter plot, I see that average fares are higher (more expensive) in rural areas.  This behavior is probably due to the fact that rural rides are longer distance than suburban or urban rides.

2. Also from the scatter plot I see that most rides are urban rides and they are relatively less expensive.

3. Pyber rides are much more popular in urban environments.  Appropriately, 4 out of 5 Pyber drivers operate in urban cities.

4. Both types of plots (scatter and pie charts) use the same data but represent the findings in dramatically different ways.  I think the scatter plot is more versatile because in one plot it can convey the meaning of three pie charts.
